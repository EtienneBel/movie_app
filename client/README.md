Advice:
1. **Prioritize MVP Features**: Focus on core functionality first. Start with a basic version that allows users to browse, search, and play videos before adding more advanced features.

2. **Mobile-First Approach**: Given the prevalence of mobile streaming, consider adopting a mobile-first design approach.

3. **Scalability**: Design your architecture with scalability in mind from the beginning, especially for data fetching and state management.

4. **User Feedback**: Implement mechanisms to collect user feedback early and often. This could include in-app surveys or feedback forms.

5. **Performance Budget**: Set performance budgets early in the development process and stick to them. This includes metrics like Time to Interactive and First Contentful Paint.

6. **Accessibility from the Start**: Build accessibility into your components from the beginning rather than treating it as an afterthought.

7. **Testing Strategy**: Develop a comprehensive testing strategy that includes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Consider implementing visual regression testing as well.

8. **Documentation**: Maintain thorough documentation throughout the development process, including component usage, API integrations, and key architectural decisions.

9. **Continuous Learning**: Stay updated with the latest best practices in video streaming technology and React ecosystem. Be prepared to refactor and improve as you learn.

10. **User Privacy**: Prioritize user data privacy and be transparent about data collection and usage practices.

Remember, building a Netflix clone is a complex project. It's important to break it down into manageable chunks and celebrate small victories along the way. Regular code reviews and team discussions can help ensure everyone is aligned and following best practices.
